# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

Predicting Home Credit Default Risk using XGBoost to assess loan repayment ability and enhance risk management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Home-Credit-Default-Risk.git
   cd Home-Credit-Default-Risk
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Place the training data (e.g., `application_train.csv`) and testing data (e.g., `application_test.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will train the XGBoost model and save the results, including the trained model and evaluation metrics.

3. Evaluate and make predictions:
   - After training, the predictions and evaluation results will be stored in the `output/` directory.
