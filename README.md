# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
Predicting Home Credit Default Risk using XGBoost to assess loan repayment ability and enhance risk management.

## 📦 Installation


1. **Clone the repository**:
```markdown
   git clone https://github.com/Beshoy13/Home-Credit-Default-Risk.git
   cd Home-Credit-Default-Risk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Place the training data (e.g., `application_train.csv`) and testing data (e.g., `application_test.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - This command trains the XGBoost model and saves the trained model and evaluation results.

3. **Check the results**:
   - Outputs such as predictions and evaluation metrics will be saved in the `output/` directory.
